 Operating System Simulation

 ## Overview 
Welcome to MyOS, a simulated operating system that implements various operating system concepts. This project aims to provide a realistic simulation of an operating system environment with multitasking capabilities, user and kernel modes, process management, and more.

## Key Features

### Boot Screen:
- Displays the name of the operating system on startup.
- Utilizes the sleep command for a loading effect.
- Hardware Resources:

RAM: 2GB
Hard Drive: 256GB
Cores: 8

### Task Management:
- Manages resources efficiently in RAM, Hard Drive, and cores.
- Implements multitasking with a minimum of 15 predefined tasks.
  
## Basic Applications:

- Notepad (with auto-save function)
- Calculator
- Time
- File Operations (Create, Move, Copy, Delete)
- Check File Info
- Minigames (Minesweeper, etc.)
  
## User Interaction:

- Processes run in separate terminals.
- Ability to close or minimize tasks manually, simulating interruptions.
  
## Multitasking:

- Scheduling techniques to manage multiple tasks concurrently.
- Implements multilevel queue with different techniques.
  
## User and Kernel Modes:

Kernel mode for accessing hardware resources and managing processes.

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Provide hardware resources during startup.
- Run the operating system simulation.
  
## Concepts Implemented
- Multitasking
- Context Switching
- Resource Allocation
- User Mode and Kernel Mode
- Process Creation
- Threads
- EXEC Commands
- Scheduling (Mutual Exclusion, Semaphore, Condition Variable)
- Multilevel Queue
  
## Types of Tasks
Full-Time Response Tasks
Background Processes
Automated Tasks (e.g., Clock)
